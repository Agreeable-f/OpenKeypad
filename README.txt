TLDR/shorter version and FAQ at the end:

NOTE: You might have to glue the hotswap sockets down otherwise they might come out when removing the switch.

Print info/settings:

NOTE: LID MUST BE FLIPPED 180Â° ON THE X OR Y AXIS SUCH THAT IT LAYS FLAT.

          All prototypes and models were printed on a prusa i3mk2s.
     .2mm layer height with 3 top and bottom solid layers and 4 perimiter/shells.
     first layer height is set to 200% with the first layer width at 100%
     Infill was set to 100% With the rectelinear pattern. No supports needed!

Pins to solder to and how to change them:

          Solder your positive pins to 5 and 15 (or what they are defined to in the code)
     and the negative pins to any of the GND pins. When doing to ensure that none of the wire 
     pokes out of the bottom of the board. You can also solder both negative pins to one GND 
     if you want, however both positive pins must be connected to separate pins. 
     You can also change what pins you'd like to solder to (with the exception of GND) 
     on lines 41-56. Un-comment the pin that you want to solder to/use 
     (remove the // on the left) and change the binding on the left side in the empty ' '.

How to solder and install Kailh hot swap sockets:

NOTE:  THICK SIDE (LEFT) GOES TO GROUND AND SKINNY SIDE (RIGHT) GOES TO THE PINOUT (5, 15 EXT.)

          Solder the wires to the defined pins in the code (default is 5 and 15) as well as the GND/ground pins
     (any will work) I used the pins that came with the board and used them as leads to solder to.
     Add a ball of solder to your iron and gently drop it into one of the two metal 
     bits on the side of the socket. If the peice melts the plastic and sags down, you
     can heat it and push it back up. To solder the wire hold the socket so that it's facing 
     bottom up. Solder the wire directly perpendicular to the socket such that it sticks straight 
     down (otherwise there will be spacing issues with the walls of the keypad). 
     
How to change what keys you want bound:

     On lines 41-56 in the code you can change each pin to a different letter 
     or modifier. To do this, simply add your key/letter in the empty ' ' on the 
     corresponding line of the pin you have soldered to.

How to install the Arduino Pro Micro:
     
          If your board has a flange/lip around the port that will need to be clipped
     in order for it to fit into the hole. position the board such that the port 
     is alligned with the hole at a slight angle. Then push the port gently into the hole
     (may use pliars if necessary).once seated press the board down such that it sits in the
     lip/border to hold it in place.

How to upload code to the arduino:

          Connect the arduino to your pc and make sure it shows up in device manager (as well as it's com port).
     select the correct com port (that you got from device manager) 
     and arduino leonardo in the tools drop down menu. Install all the required libraries. 
     Click the upload button and let it finish.

TLDR;/short and concise version:

          Solder wires to pins 5 and 15 (default) and GND/ground. If using hot swap sockets left (thick side) is gnd.
     To change the keys/pins change the definitions on lines 41-56. To insert the arduino
     line up the port with the hole and push it in and down. then upload the code and you're done.

NOTE: You might have to glue the hot swap sockets down otherwise they might come out when removing the switch.


FAQ:

Q: do i have to upload the code every time i plug it in?
A: Nope! this is a one time code upload

Q: can i use this on other computers?
A: Yes! as long as you set your binds correctly in osu!.

Q: can i use any switch?
A: Yes! however if you are using hot swap sockets then only gateron style switches.
