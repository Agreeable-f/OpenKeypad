Pins to solder to and how to change them:

          Solder your positive pins to 5 and 15 and the negative pins
     to any of the  pins. You can also solder both negative pins to one ground 
     if you want, however both positive pins must be connected
     to separate pins. you can also change what pins you'd like to solder to 
     (with the exception of gnd) on lines 15-25. chose the corresponding pin
     for the key you binded on lines 5-13 and un-comment them. Also remember to 
     un-comment the pins on lines 61-69.
     
How to change what keys you want binded:

     On lines 5-13 in the code you can change each pin to a different letter 
     however since there are only two buttons you should only need to change
     the non commented lines (5 and 7). if you do change any of the other keys
     make sure to un-comment the correct pins on lines 61-69.
